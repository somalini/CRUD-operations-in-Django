# CRUD-operations-in-Django

##What is Django ?

● Django is a web-framework. It is based on python. Web applications can be 
created smoothly with the help of this framework.
● A framework can be viewed as a toolkit of all components which are needed 
for the application development.
● Django is free and open-source.
● It is ridiculously fast. It helps developers complete their web applications 
with speed.
● It is very secure. Django doesn’t let developers make common security 
mistakes.
● It is exceedingly scalable.

## Why use Django?

● Versatility: Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website — from content 
management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any 
client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, 
JSON, XML, etc). 
● Maintainability: Django code is written using design principles and patterns that encourage the 
creation of maintainable and reusable code. In particular, it makes use of the Don't Repeat Yourself 
(DRY) principle so there is no unnecessary duplication, reducing the amount of code.
● Portability: Django is written in Python, which runs on many platforms. That means that you are 
not tied to any particular server platform, and can run your applications on many flavours of Linux, 
Windows, and Mac OS X.

##Django MVT

● MVT stands for Model View Template.
● Django is based on MVT architecture.
● The MVT is a software design pattern for developing a web application.
● MVT structure has the following three parts:

Model - It acts as the interface of the data.t is responsible for maintaining data. It is 
the logical data structure behind the entire application and is represented by a 
database (generally relational databases such as SQLite,MySql, Postgres).

View - The View is the user interface — what the user sees in the browser when 
he/she renders a website. It is represented by HTML/CSS/Javascript files.

Template - It handles the user interface part completely.

● Although Django follows MVC pattern but maintains it’s own conventions. So, control is handled by the framework itself.
● There is no separate controller and complete application is based on Model, View and Template. That’s why it is called MVT application.


## Django CRUD

● A Django web application can be built with the help of CRUD approach. CRUD stands for Create, 
Retrieve, Update and Delete. These four basic operations can be performed on Database Models.
● Web applications can be created in Django which can perform these four basic operations.

● The CRUD operations are defined below:
 Create operation - The property by which a database stores data.
 Read operation - The property by which an application reads data from the database.
 Update operation - The property by which an application can modify values stored in the database.
 Delete Operation - The property by which an application can delete values in the database.
 
## CRUD applications

● A CRUD application is one that utilizes forms to retrieve and return data 
from a database.
● Most of the applications that we use in our day-to-day lives are CRUD 
applications.
● Most of us use Facebook on a daily basis. Whatever stories or data that we 
come across on our feed correspond to the Read operation.
● Whenever a user uploads a new profile picture, he/she performs the Update 
operation.
● If we delete our facebook account, it corresponds to the delete operation.
● So, in short, almost all the applications are CRUD applications.Thank You
